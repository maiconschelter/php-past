PHP3 Dynamically Loadable Libraries

Try:

./setup
make

Note, you may not want to compile all the libraries here.

To build an individual library instead of all of them, use:

   make calendar.so

You can then put the library somewhere and from within PHP
use: dl("/path/calendar.so");

A function from within the library can then be called like any
regular PHP function.  For example:

   echo jdmonthname(1,3);
