|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
July 04 1998 Version 3.0.1
- echo/print of empty strings don't trigger sending the header anymore.
- Implemented shift left and shift right operators (<< and >>)
- Compile fix for cc on HP-UX.
- Look for beta-version Solid libraries as well.
- Make GD module show more info in phpinfo().

- Fix for Oracle extension on OSF/1.
- Fix gd 1.3 bug in ImageColorAt().
- pg_loread() hopefully handles binary data now.
- Turned off some warnings in dns.c
- Added ImageTTFBBox() and made ImageTTFText() return bounding box.
- Added constants for Ora_Bind()'s modes.
- Renamed all hash_*() routines to _php3_hash_*() to avoid clashes with other
  libraries.
- Changed uodbc default LONG behaviour: longreadlen 4096 bytes, binmode 1.
  The module now actually uses the php.ini settings.
- New PostgreSQL functions:  pg_fetch_row(), pg_fetch_array()
  and pg_fetch_object()
- Fix a segmentation fault when calling invalid functions in certain
  circumstances
- Fix bug that caused link-related functions to not pay attention to
  run-time safe mode setting (it was using whatever was set at compile time).

June 6 1998 Version 3.0
- Add checkdnsrr function (check availability DNS records)
- Add getmxrr function (get MX hostnames and weights)
- Fixed bug in nl2br() function
- Fix for an RC5 related problem in the Sybase module, when dealing
  with very long data types.
- Speed up string concatenation by roughly a factor of 2
- Add escape-handling to date function
- Make base64 functions binary safe
- Add strrpos function to complement strpos function added in RC5
- Add ltrim function (strips only at the start of string)
- Add rtrim as an alias to chop() for completeness sake
- Add trim function (similar to chop, except it strips at the start as well)
- Added 2 optional args to fsockopen function - errno and errstr
- Fixed bug in split() function related to leading matches
- Fixed problem in error_log() function (thanks to Jan Legenhausen)
- empty("0") was returning true - fixed
- Removed the old sybsql module.  Use the new sybase_*() functions instead.
- Several fixes to the configuration file parser
- LDAP fixes - fixed return values on several functions

May 23 1998 Version 3.0RC5
- The BC math library functions now compile in by default.
- Fixed a bug in virtual() and other types of SSI's (e.g. <!--#exec).  Under
  certain circumstances, this used to result in random problems.
- Fixed a bug in virtual().  It was misbehaving if it was called before any
  other output.
- Added mysql.default_port, mysql.default_host, mysql.default_user and
  mysql.default_password ini-file directives.
- Improved handling of the MySQL default port.  It now honors /etc/services
  and $MYSQL_TCP_PORT.
- Fixed a crash in opening of broken ftp:// URLs, and improved error reporting
  in opening of URLs.
- Fixed several non-critical scanner issues with syntax highlighting mode and
  the <script language=php> tag.
- Fixed fseek on windows.  (windows only): fseek will not return proper results
  on files opened as text mode.  PHP uses binary mode as the default for file
  operations, but this can be overiden by fopen.  Do not open files in text
  mode and use fseek on them!
- Add strpos() function
- Added zlib module, requires zlib >= 1.0.9
- Improved the module API implementation.  Dynamic modules may now register
  persistent resources (not that it makes much sense, but at least PHP
  won't crash).  The API itself remains unchanged.
- bcmod() wasn't always behaving like modulus should behave (it was behaving
  exactly like GNU bc's % operator).  Fixed.
- Changed the Sybase-DB module to always return strings, instead of auto-typing
  result sets.  This was done for consistency with the other database modules,
  and in order to avoid overflows due to the platform-dependant limitations
  of the numeric data types of PHP.  You can turn compatability mode on using
  the sybase.compatability_mode directive in the php3.ini file.
- Fixed problems with the TINYINT field in the Sybase-CT module.
- Applied some small speed optimizations to the Sybase-DB module querying code.
- Added 'numeric' and 'type' properties to the object returned by
  sybase_fetch_field().
- The 'new' operator doesn't accept all expressions anymore.  Instead, it
  accepts a class name, or a variable reference (scalar, array element, etc).
- Add ora_numcols() function
- Add ora_do() and ora_fetch_into() functions to Oracle driver
- Add persistent connection support to Oracle driver
- Make Oracle driver clean up open connections and open cursors automatically
- Added fread() and fwrite() that properly handle binary data.
- Add Ora_ColumnSize() to Oracle code
- The string "0" means FALSE again.  This was done in order to maintain type
  conversion consistency.
- Added solid_fetch_prev() for fetching the previous result row from Solid.
- Huge integers are now automatically converted to floating point numbers
  (that have a wider range).
- Floating point numbers are now displayed using scientific notation when
  they're extremely big or extremely small.  The 'precision' php3.ini directive
  no longer designates the number of decimal digits, but rather, the maximum
  number of significant digits required.
- Added support for scientific notation for floating point numbers (e.g. 1E7)
  throughout the entire language.
- Fixed a potential/probable memory corruption problem with HEAD request
  handling.
- Using un-encapsulated strings now generates a NOTICE-level warning
  (e.g. $a = foo; instead of $a = "foo";)
- Added defined("name") function to check if a certain constant is defined
  or not.
- Support new Apache mechanism for setting SERVER_SUBVERSION
- Added PHP_OS and PHP_VERSION constants
- Added the ability to define constants in runtime!  Constants are script-wide,
  (there's no scope, once the constant is defined, it's valid everywhere).
  Syntax is define("name", $value [, $case_insensitive]).  'name' can be any name
  that is a valid variable name, *without* the $ prefix.  'value' can be
  any *scalar* value.  If the optional 'case_insensitive' parameter is 1,
  then the constant is created case-insensitive (the default is case
  sensitive).  Note:  define() is currently *NOT* supported in preprocessed
  scripts.
- Added general support for constants.  The Syslog constants (e.g.
  LOG_ERR, LOG_CRIT, etc.) should be accessed as constants from now on (that
  is, without a $ prefix).  You can still set define_syslog_variables to On
  in the php3.ini file if you want to define the various $ variables.  The
  default for this directive in the php3.ini-dist file has been changed to
  Off.
- The configuration file path variable now expands . and .. into their
  respective directories.  You can obtain the path of the php3.ini file
  that was used by printing get_cfg_var("cfg_file_path").
- Fixed a crash-recovery parser crash ($a=7; $a[3]+=5;)
- Add gmmktime() function
- Fixed a crash with implode() and empty arrays.
- Fixed a bug that, under fairly rare circumstances, caused PHP not to
  recognize if(), require() and other statements as statements, and
  to complain about them as being unsupported functions.
- Beautified php3.ini-dist and added more comments to it.  Also changed
  the behavior of the configuration file parser to be brighter about
  the various constants (TRUE/FALSE/ON/OFF etc).
- Fixed a bug in openlog() - the specified device name was being mangled.
- Memory leaks were sometimes reported erroneously - fixed.
- Improved the convertor to handle some quirks of the PHP/FI 2 parser with
  comments.
- Fixed number_format() to properly handle negative numbers, and optimized it
  a bit.
- Fixed static variables inside class member functions.  Note that using such
  static variables inside member functions usually defeats the purpose of
  objects, so it is not recommended.
- Fixed a bug in fpassthru() (the file was being closed twice).
- Added strftime().
- Add set_socket_blocking() function to control blocking on socket fd's
- The sendmail_path in php3.ini was being ignored - fixed.
- Fixed a bug with file upload, with files that contained the MIME boundary
  inside them.
- Fixed a bug with form variables of type array, with spaces in their
  index (e.g. name="foo[bar bar]").
- gd-1.3 autodetect and support
- Year 2000 compliance is now togglable from the php3.ini file.  Setting PHP
  to be y2k compliant effects the way it creates cookies, and means it'll
  NOT work with many browsers out there that are not y2k compliant!  For
  that reason, the default for this option is off.
- safe mode / fix from monti@vesatec.com
- Integrated the FreeType support in the GD extension.
- Added --with-gd=DIR and --without-gd options to configure

April 18 1998 Version 3.0 Release Candidate 4
- Auto-prepended and auto-appended files were reporting the wrong filename
  in errors and in __FILE__ - fixed.
- Fix GPC problem related to mixed scalar and array vars with the same name
- Made putenv() Apache-safe.  Environment variables may no longer leak in
  between requests.
- The trailing semicolon is no longer required in class declarations.
- Fixed a memory leak in the (array) and (object) operators under certain
  conditions.
- <script> tags weren't working unless short tags were enabled - Fixed.
- Fixed a bug in certain array indices that weren't treated as numbers
  even though they looked like numbers (e.g. "10", "20").
- Changes to support renamed API functions in Apache-1.3
- Fixed the -p and -e command line switches
- Fix a segfault when calling command line version without parameters
- Fix for feof() when used on a socket
- Fix off-by-one error in fgets() when used on a socket
- Fix bug in ImageSetPixel() (Thanks to ecain@Phosphor.net)

March 31 1998 Version 3.0 Release Candidate 3
- Tiny bugfix for magic_quotes_sybase
- Fix Apache build problems introduced in RC2
- $a["0"]==$a[0] fix
- Apache-1.3 build changes to support 100% automatic builds and shared library
  module builds.  See INSTALL file.
 
March 30 1998 Version 3.0 Release Candidate 2
- Changed the socket implementation under UNIX to not use FILE pointers, in
  order to work around the buggy Solaris libc (and possibly buggy libc's
  in other platforms).
- Fixed a bug in min() and max() with certain arrays.
- *WARNING* Move Apache 1.3 php3 file install to src/modules/php3 instead of 
  src/modules/extra.  Make sure you change your AddModule line correctly
  in your Apache Configuration file.  This change is to take advantage of 
  new Apache-1.3 configuration mechanism which makes it easier to build an
  Apache server with PHP automatically enabled.  It will also help building
  a shared library module version of PHP soon.
- Fixed a crash bug with auto-appended files.
- Made --enable-discard-path work on all Unix servers #!/path/php CGI scripts 
  should now work everywhere.  I have tested on Apache, WN and Netscape 2.0
- Made $a["123"] and $a[123] be identical.  $a["0123"] is still different,
  though.
- Added 'precision' ini directive, to set the number of decimal digits
  displayed for floating point numbers (default - 6).
- Made integer/integer divisions evaluate to floating point numbers when
  applicable (e.g., 5/2==2.5(float), but 4/2==2(int))
- Get rid of reliance on tied streams and move all socket reads and writes
  to recv/send calls
- Cleaned up head.c a bit and fixed CGI SetCookie order problem
- Changed default variable parsing order to Get-Cookie-Post (GPC)
- Fixed setup so it has all configure options and defaults.
- Added optional decimal point and thousands seperator to number_format()
  e.g., number_format(1500,2,',','.') == 1.500,00
- Fixed cgi bug in windows that prevented files from being parsed on many
  systems and servers.

March 23 1998 Version 3.0 Release Candidate
- Added support for the Raima database (ALPHA)
- Fixed a bug in persistent PostgreSQL links and the connection-string method.
- Added EXTENSION_STATUS file, that specifies the stability and status of
  every module in the distribution.
- Added optional parameters to user functions with default values, variables
  that are forced to be passed by reference and variables that can be
  optionally passed by reference.  The ini file directive
  'ignore_missing_userfunc_args' is no longer supported.
- Added fhttpd support (by Alex Belits)
- Improved performance by approximately 20-30%.
- Added mysql_error(), mysql_errno() (if available) and msql_error().
  Errors coming back from the database backend no longer issue warnings.
  Instead, use these functions to retreive the error.
- Patched count(), each(), prev(), next(), reset() and end() to work around
  the implementation side effects of unset().  As far as the users are
  concerned, this should be transparent now (even though it's slower now,
  until it's thoroughly fixed in 3.1).
- Added number_format().  number_format(2499,2)=='2,499.00'.
- error_reporting() now sets the error reporting level to the supplied
  argument, without any interpretations.
- Fixed a lookahead parser bug that occured under rare circumstances.
- Change the comparison operators to compare numeric strings as numbers.  If
  you want to compare them as strings, you can use the new C-like strcmp()
- Fixed Ora_GetColumn() bug when fetching strings
- Added Ora_ColumnName() and Ora_ColumnType()
- Preliminary LONG and LONG RAW support in Oracle extension
- Add \123 and \xAB style octal and hex escapes to "" and `` strings
- Add "-c" command line flag for specifying path to php3.ini file
- Improved list() so that elements can be skipped, for example:
  list($name,,,$realname) = explode(":",fgets($passwd_file));
- Fixed a tiny bug in the hash initialization which caused excessive use of
  memory. Report and fix by short@k332.feld.cvut.cz
- Fixed strtolower() and strtoupper() to work with 8-bit chars
- Fixed to compile and run on SunOS 4.1

  and didn't work with arrays.
- Made [m,My]SQL create/drop database functions return success status
- Fixed some memory leak/crash problems in the Adabas module
- Added each() in order to allow for easy and correct array traversing.
- Make Apache module version respect LOCALE setting
- Add support for Apache 1.3b6+ ap_config.h file
- Fixed a nasty corruption bug in eval() and show_source() that resulted in
  script termination (e.g. eval("exit();").
- Fixed a syntax highlighting problem with keywords used as variable
  names.
- Fixed a possible crash and/or file descriptor leak
- Fixed line number being off by one in #! shell style execution
- Made it possible to disable auto_prepend/append with "none" filename
- Allow safe CGI calling through #!php style scripts

  which are refered to as objects.
- Fixed several fields that were being incorrectly read in Sybase CT.
- Fix Apache-1.3 related SIGHUP problem which was preventing php3.ini from 
  getting re-read on a SIGHUP
- *** WARNING *** Downwards incompatible change:  The plus operator (+) is not
  longer overloaded as concatenation for strings.  Instead, it converts its
  arguments to numbers and performs numeric addition.
- Add Stig and Tin's bdf2gdfont script to extra/gd directory
- Added join() as an alias to implode()
- Made implode() accept arguments in the order used by explode() as well

- Fixed a 'memory leak' with strtok()
- echo/print now handle binary data correctly.
- NEW now accepts any expression for the class name argument.
- Add ImageDashedLine() GD function
- Add arg_separator .ini directive so the '&' GET method separator can be
  changed to ';' for example.  Corresponding php3_arg_separator Apache .conf
  directive works as well.
- Walked around an implementation side effect of switch().  <? switch(expr) { ?>
  now works.
- Added memory caching, resulting in a significant performance boost
- Added support for for(): .. endfor; loops
- Added a new predicate - empty($var).  Returns true if $var is not set,
  or is FALSE.  Returns false otherwise.
- Added is_integer() (same as is_long()) and is_real() (same as is_double()).
- Added sizeof() as an alias to the count() function
- Added --enable-force-cgi-redirect, to prevent the CGI from working if
  someone directly accesses PHP not through Apache's CGI redirect
  (off by default).
- Fixed marking of deleted dBase records. Noticed by Simon Gornall
  <simon@oyster.co.uk>.
- Fixed fixed "%%" bug in [s]printf
- Fixed a UMR (initialized memory read) in the Oracle code
- Potential fix for mysql-related SIGPIPE problem which caused httpd to spin
- Made PHP responsive to the Apache link status (stop executing if the link
  dies).
- Fixed a crash bug with StrongHold and secure pages
- Fixed StrongHold installation
- Optimized the function call sequence a bit.
- Fixed Sybase/CT date/datetime/money fields work to correctly.
- Fixed Apache module startup problems - php3_module_startup should only be
  called once.
- Fixed ord() with characters >127
- Fixed bug in file_exists() function
- Fixed stripslashes() to remove the escaping quote (instead of backslash)
  in case magic_quotes_sybase is true.
- Also make echo and print automatically remove trailing decimal zeros.
- Added htmlentities(), currently handling only ISO-8859-1 entities
- "0" is no longer considered false, the only string which is false is the
  empty string "".
- Added 'true' and 'false' keywords
- Added 'xor' (logical exclusive or)
- Automatic conversion from double to string removes decimal trailing zeros.

- Fixed a file descriptor leak in the configuration parser.
- Fixed a few buglets with syntax highlighting with certain language keywords
- Added functions to control minimum severity level of Sybase messages to
  display.
- Added highlight_string() - behaves like highlight_file(), only instead
  of highlighting a file, it syntax highlights the contents of its
  argument.
- Renamed show_source() to highlight_file().  show_source() is still
  supported for downwards compatability.
- Fixed a bug in class inheritence - member functions with upper case
  letters in their names couldn't be redefined.
- Made chown(), chgrp() and chmod() return TRUE/FALSE instead of 0/-1.

February 02 1998 Version 3.0b4
- Fixed a segfault bug in one of the unified ODBC error messages.
- Set default file modes to binary on win32 (solved a lot of bs)
- Fixed file copy on win32
- MIME file uploads fixed on win32
- Added contributed icons by Colin Viebrock (undex extra/icons)
- Fixed the debugger enough to call it "beta code".

  and currently parsed line respectively.
- Added ImageColorAt(), ImageColorSet(), ImageColorsForIndex(), and
  ImageColorsTotal() to allow manipulating the palette of GIF images.
- Rename '--enable-url-includes' option to '--enable-url-fopen-wrapper' to
  better describe what it does, and pay attention to the setting.
- Added optional parameter to the file(), readfile()  and fopen() functions
  to look for files located in the include path.
- Fixed bug that allowed the file() and readfile() to open files in the
  include path inadvertantly.
- Fixed a (documented) bug in printf()/sprintf() with hard limited strings
  and alignment (e.g. %-.20s).
- Optimized several quoted string routines.
- Added error_log ini directive to select where errors get logged when
  log_errors is turned on or the error_log() function is used.
- Added the ability to direct errors to log files instead of or in addition
  to the script output.  Use the new display_errors and log_errors
  php3.ini directives.
- Made environment variables uneraseable by POST/GET/Cookie variables.
- Fixed a bug in the elseif() construct.  The expression was being evaluated
  even if a previous if/elseif already evaluated to true and got executed.
- Fixed a bug in the exit code parameter of system()
- Tighten up all exec() related functions in safe mode
- Added error_log() function to log messages to the server error log, or

  escapes ($foo = `...`)
- Made keywords be valid property names of objects.
- Fixed a segfault bug when creating new objects of an unknown class.
- Fixed a problem with the maximum execution time limit, that may have
  prevented this feature from working on certain platforms.
- PHP would now warn you with E_NOTICE about unknown escape characters,
  e.g. "\f".  It would still be considered as a backslash followed by f,
  but the proper way of writing this is "\\f" or '\f'.
- Added support for ${...} inside encapsulated strings.  Supported:  ${foo},
  ${foo[bar]}, ${foo[0]}, ${$foo[$bar]}, ${$foo->bar} and ${$foo}
- Fixed a bug in automatic persistent link reconnect of the Sybase/DB module.
  Thanks to Steve Willer for finding that 'stealth' bug!
- Fixed a crash bug in the GET/POST/Cookie parser in case of regular
  and array variables with the same name.

- Fixed bug in gethostby*() functions that resulted in a core dump.
  (Noticed by torben@coastnet.com.)
- Fixed bug in dbase_get_record that prevented number and date fields
  from being properly decoded. (Thanks again to colins@infofind.com.)
- Make dbase_get_record include a 'deleted' field that indicates whether
  that record had been marked for deletion.
- Fixed bug in dbase library that stomped on the deleted flag of the first
  record in the file if it was set. (Thanks to colins@infofind.com.)
- Fixed putenv() to not report a memory leak and possibly prevent a bug
  from that memory being freed.
- Added setlocale()
- Added pg_fieldisnull() (by Stephan Duehr)
- Changed pg_exec() to always return a result identifier on succees
- Solid linking fixes (tries to find the right library)
- Fixed a but with date() and the 'w' element.
- Tried to eliminate unimportant memory leak notifications.
- Made min() and max() backwards compatible and able to handle doubles.
- Add fgetc() function
- Fixed bug in getmyuid(), getmyinode() and getlastmod(). Thanks to
  khim@sch57.msk.ru for pointing this out.
- Fixed http:// URL includes with no path specified send request for /.
- Added GetAllHeaders() (Apache-only)
- Added workaround that made the Image text functions 8-bit clean
- Made snmp internally compilable for win32 (not the unix one though),
  only adds 2k to binary size, so no reason not to have it there.
- Fixed ldap loading on win32
- Fixed MySQL Info function on win32 platform
- Fixed compilation of syntax highlighting mode

January 17 1998 Version 3.0b3
- Added mysql support under windows ;)  happy happy joy joy
- Fixed dbase.dll for win32 to actualy load now.
- Enhanced the convertor to recognize ?> as a php-close-block as well.
- Fixed potential SetCookie() core dumps
- Changed print to be an expression instead of a statement.  That means you can
  now do stuff like foobar() or print("Unable to foobar!").  echo has NOT been
  changed.
- Removed the flex optimization flags to reduce the size of the scanner
- Added memory leak logging into apache log files (apache module only)
- Fixed a nasty bug in one of the internal stacks.  This may have caused
  random crashes in several occassions.

- error_reporting() now returns the old error reporting level
- Fixed url includes/opens not working under win32
- Fixed errorneous handling of multipart/form-data input
- Added rawurlencode(), rawurldecode() and changed urlencode() and urldecode() 
  a bit too.
- Fixed a bug in [s]printf, sign was forgotten for doubles.
- Fixed a segfault bug in pg_fieldprtlen(), and made it accept field names
  in addition to field offsets.
- Made the setup script a little more user-friendly.
- Added is_long(), is_double(), is_string(), is_array() and is_object()
- Fixed a bug in freeing of mSQL results.

  return rows (i.e. insert, update, create, etc)
- Added get_cfg_var() to enable checking cfg file directives from within
  a script.
- Fixed a bug with urlencode() and characters 0x80-0xff
- Changed the behaviour of ereg_replace to more intuitive.  The
  backslashes other than valid existing back references in the second
  argument are no more evaluated as escape sequences.
- Fixed a bug in the configuration file loader and safe mode.
- Fixed a bug with configuration variables taken from the environment.
- Added <script language=php> </script> as PHP open/close tags, to allow
  the use of editors such as Microsoft Frontpage.
- Fixed a bug in the default php3.ini directory - it wasn't defaulting to
  /usr/local/lib properly.
- Added support for \r\n line endings
- Fixed a bug that may have prevented POST method variables from working 
  with certain scripts when using the CGI version.
- Convertor:  Added support for single-quoted strings

  rows (update, insert, etc).

December 22 1997 Version 3.0b2
- Changed variable type conversions that do not specify base to always use
  base 10.  "010" is no more 8, it is 10.  Use intval ($x, 0) to get C-style
  octal and hex numbers recognized.
- Fixed a possible segfault bug in several functions, when using the concat
  operator and possibly other operators/functions.
- # is no longer accepted as a comment in php3.ini.  Use ; instead.
- Added browscap support
- Configuration file directives are now case-sensitive
- Fixed msql_tablename() and msql_dbname()
- Added a PHP/FI 2.0 -> PHP 3.0 convertor

- Added support for execution of external programs using backquotes ($a=`ls -l`)
- fixed mail() on windows, also fixed memory leaks in mail on windows
- added sendmail_from to handle return route on windows
- Changed the way the config file is searched.  The file name is now
  php3.ini (hardcoded), and it'll be looked for in:  local directory, $PHPRC
  and builtin path designated by ./configure under UNIX or Windows directory 
  under Windows.
- Fixed ereg_replace replacing empty matches and a one off buffer overflow
- Fixed File upload on windows platform
- Fixed a bug that caused 'HTTP/1.1 100 Continue' messages with 
  Internet Explorer 4.0 and certain scripts that receive POST variables
- Get/POST/Cookie data variables are from now *ALWAYS* strings.  If you want
  to use them in integer/real context, you must explicitly change their types.
  This was done in order to avoid possible loss of data when doing these
  conversions automatically.
- Variables named as keywords are now allowed (e.g. $function, $class, etc)
- Fixed a problem with msql() and mysql() with NULL fields
- Fixed a segfault bug with class declarations

  unconditional include is now require()

December 08 1997 Version 3.0b1
- Switched to public beta test phase
- Generalized unset() and isset() to work on any type of variables, including
  specific array indices or object properties (e.g., unset($a[4]) now works).
- Added support for object references inside encapsulated strings
  (for example, 'echo "Username:  $user->name"' now works)
- Added arbitary precision math support (basic operations with
  unlimited range numbers, and support for unlimited decimal digits)
- Apache module can now handle preprocessed scripts (by using:
	AddType application/x-httpd-php3-preprocessed .php3p
  in the Apache configuration)
- Made settype() pass its first parameter by value.  Improved it to be able
  to convert to arrays and objects (originally by Steve Willer)
- Implemented CPU time limit on scripts when setitimer() is available
- Computed field names in the Sybase/CT and Sybase/DB modules are now named
  computed, computed1, computed2, ...
- Added Sybase/CT client/server message handlers and updated the Sybase/DB ones
- Made the regexp function automatically take arguments by reference
  when necessary
- Added builtin support for auto append and prepend in the parser level
- Improved the Sybase/CT sybase_query().  Should be more stable now, and
  hopefully work with a wider range of queries.  It's difficult to work
  without docs, though, so it may still not be 100% right...
- Changed error messages to show error type, file and line with bold
- Added support for autoprepend and autoprepend
- Added some more warning flags if gcc is used

December 03 1997 Version 3.0a4
- Improved the internal functions API - no need to explicitly pass
  parameters by reference to internal functions that specifically
  require them, e.g. sort(), ksort(), reset(), count(), etc.
  This is *STILL* downwards compatible with the previous alphas,
  in the sense that you can explicitly pass the arguments by reference
  if you want to.
- use srandom/random instead of srand/rand if available
- Added [m,My]sql_listfields() for downwards compatability
- -p now replaces .php3 extension with .php3p (otherwise it adds .php3p)

- Added \0 back reference for full string match to *reg*_replace and
  added backslash escaping to replace string
- Fixed a few bugs in the Sybase DB-library module.
- Added Sybase CT-library support.  It should be considered experimental.
  Syntax is identical to the one of the DB-library.  Allows people to
  connect to MS-SQL servers from Linux without having to pay for a
  library!

- Add ImageColorClosest() and ImageColorExact() GD functions
- Make all .ini directives work as Apache .conf directives as well
