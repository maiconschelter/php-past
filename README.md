PHP Museum Git Archive
======================

This repository represents the combined history of available PHP releases prior to PHP-4.0 (after which point, the official php-src repository contains full commit histories).  While this repository contains neither a complete history, nor a commit-by-commit breakdown of the project, it does provide tags and branches covering the point-in-time changes between released versions of the runtime as found at museum.php.net.

All commits have been attributed to rasmus@php.net, however it should be noted that many contributors participated in the creation of PHP, even in these early days.  Additionally, the dates used for these commits represent a best guess for when the package MAY have been released since that information appears to be lost to the past.

The software contained in this repository is the property of the PHP project and all existing license terms and conditions apply.
