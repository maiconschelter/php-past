  <title>Reporting Errors</title>

  <simpara>
   To report errors from an internal function, you should call the
   <function>php3_error()</function> function. This takes at least two
   parameters -- the first is the level of the error, the second is
   the format string for the error message (as in a standard
   <function>printf()</function> call), and any following arguments
   are the parameters for the format string. The error levels are:

  <sect2 id="internal.e-notice">
   <title>E_NOTICE</title>
   <simpara>
    Notices are not printed by default, and indicate that the script
    encountered something that could indicate an error, but could also
    happen in the normal course of running a script. For example,
    trying to access the value of a variable which has not been set,
    or calling <link linkend="function.stat">stat()</link> on a
    file that doesn't exist.
   </simpara>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="internal.e-warning">
   <title>E_WARNING</title>
   <simpara>
    Warnings are printed by default, but do not interrupt script
    execution.  These indicate a problem that should have been trapped
    by the script before the call was made. For example, calling <link
    linkend="function.ereg">ereg()</link> with an invalid regular
    expression.
   </simpara>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
   <title>E_ERROR</title>
   <simpara>
    Errors are also printed by default, and execution of the script is
    halted after the function returns. These indicate errors that can
    not be recovered from, such as a memory allocation problem.
   </simpara>

  <sect2>
   <title>E_PARSE</title>
   <simpara>
    Parse errors should only be generated by the parser. The code is
    listed here only for the sake of completeness.
