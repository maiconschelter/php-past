>&#13;    PHP is capable of receiving file uploads from any RFC-1867
    compliant browser (which includes Netscape Navigator 3 or later,
    Microsoft Internet Explorer 3 with a patch from Microsoft, or
    later without a patch).  This feature lets people upload both text
    and binary files.  With PHP's authentication and file manipulation
    functions, you have full control over who is allowed to upload and
    what is to be done with the file once it has been uploaded.
   </P
><P
>&#13;    Note that PHP also supports PUT-method file uploads as used by
    Netscape Composer and W3C's Amaya clients.  See the <A
HREF="features.file-upload.put-method.html"
>PUT Method
    Support</A
> for more details.
   </P
><P
>&#13;    A file upload screen can be built by creating a special form which
    looks something like this:
    <TABLE
WIDTH="100%"
BORDER="0"
CELLPADDING="0"
CELLSPACING="0"
CLASS="EXAMPLE"
><TR
><TD
><DIV
CLASS="example"
><P
><B
>Example 19-1. File Upload Form</B
></P
><TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;&#60;FORM ENCTYPE="multipart/form-data" ACTION="_URL_" METHOD=POST&#62;
&#60;INPUT TYPE="hidden" name="MAX_FILE_SIZE" value="1000"&#62;
Send this file: &#60;INPUT NAME="userfile" TYPE="file"&#62;
&#60;INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="Send File"&#62;
&#60;/FORM&#62;
     </PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></DIV
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
    The _URL_ should point to a PHP file.  The MAX_FILE_SIZE hidden
    field must precede the file input field and its value is the maximum
    filesize accepted.  The value is in bytes.  In this destination file,
    the following variables will be defined upon a successful upload:
   </P
><P
>&#13;    <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;       $userfile - The temporary filename in which the uploaded file
       was stored on the server machine.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;       $userfile_name - The original name or path of the file on the 
       sender's system.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;       $userfile_size - The size of the uploaded file in bytes.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;       $userfile_type - The mime type of the file if the browser
       provided this information.  An example would be
       "image/gif".
      </P
></LI
></UL
>
    Note that the "$userfile" part of the above variables is
    whatever the name of the INPUT field of TYPE=file is in the upload
    form.  In the above upload form example, we chose to call it
    "userfile".
   </P
><P
>&#13;    Files will by default be stored in the server's default temporary
    directory.  This can be changed by setting the environment variable
    <TT
CLASS="envar"
>TMPDIR</TT
> in the environment in which PHP runs.  Setting
    it using <A
HREF="function.putenv.html"
><B
CLASS="function"
>putenv()</B
></A
> from within a PHP script will
    not work.
   </P
><P
>&#13;    The PHP script which receives the uploaded file should implement
    whatever logic is necessary for determining what should be done
    with the uploaded file.  You can for example use the $file_size
    variable to throw away any files that are either too small or too
    big.  You could use the $file_type variable to throw away any
    files that didn't match a certain type criteria.  Whatever the
    logic, you should either delete the file from the temporary
    directory or move it elsewhere.
   </P
><P
>&#13;    The file will be deleted from the temporary directory at the end
    of the request if it has not been moved away or renamed.
