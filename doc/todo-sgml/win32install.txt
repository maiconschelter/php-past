Installing PHP on Windows95/NT

Apache/NT & Stonghold/NT
	Follow the instructions for configuration under Unix.

IIS and MS-PWS

	You can access php scripts simply by putting the php.exe file
 	into your scripts directory and using a url such as:
	http://my.server/scripts/php.exe/page.php

	Redirection
	If you would like to use a url like:
	http://my.server/page.php
	you will have to edit your registry.  

Disclaimer: Be sure you make a backup of your registry before editing it.  The PHP Development Team is not responsible for damaged registries.  If you damage your registry, you may not be able to restart your computer without reinstalling your OS!

	You can edit your registry by running regedit.exe.  To do this, choose Run... from the Start menu, and type 'regedit' then click on OK.
The registry setting you need to edit is:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE:System:CurrentControlSet:Services:W3Svc:Parameters:ScriptMap
Add a new string value here with the extension you would like to use for your php scripts, and make the value data the path to the php executable:
.phtm3  "c:\webshare\scripts\php.exe"

For the ISAPI version of PHP, use something like:
.phtm	"c:\webshare\scripts\php3_isapi.dll"

You must also make any directories containing php scripts executable.  This is done in the IIS administrator.  Consult your IIS documentation for more information.

Other Servers
	Consult your server documentation.

PHP.INI File
	Under Windows, PHP will look for php3.ini automaticly, first under the windows os directory (c:\windows or c:\winnt) then in the directory in which the PHP executable resides.  Alternately, you can set the environment variable PHPRC=\pathto\php3.ini  though this does not work with all servers (apache for one).
