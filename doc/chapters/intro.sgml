    Perhaps the strongest and most significant feature in PHP3 is its
    database integration layer.  Writing a database-enabled web page
    is incredibly simple.  The following databases are currently
    supported:
    <blockquote>
     <simplelist columns=2>
      <member>Oracle</member>
      <member>Sybase</member>
      <member>mSQL</member>
      <member>MySQL</member>
      <member>Solid</member>
      <member>ODBC</member>
      <member>PostgreSQL</member>
      <member>Adabas D</member>
      <member>FilePro</member>
      <member>Velocis</member>

   <title>A Brief History of PHP</title>
   <simpara>
    PHP was conceived sometime in the fall of 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf.
    Early non-released versions were used on his home page to keep track
    of who was looking at his online resume.  The first version used
    by others was available sometime in early 1995 and was known as
    the Personal Home Page Tools.  It consisted of a very simplistic
    parser engine that only understood a few special macros and a
    number of utilities that were in common use on home pages back then.
    A guestbook, a counter and some other stuff.  The parser was rewritten
    in mid-1995 and named PHP/FI Version 2.  The FI came from another package
    Rasmus had written which interpreted html form data.  He combined
    the Personal Home Page tools scripts with the Form Interpreter and
    added mSQL support and PHP/FI was born.  PHP/FI grew at an amazing
    pace and people started contributing code to it.

   <simpara>
    It is hard to give any hard statistics, but it is estimated that
    by late 1996 PHP/FI was in use on at least 15,000 web sites around
    the world.  By mid-1997 this number had grown to over 50,000.
    Mid-1997 also saw a change in the development of PHP.  It changed
    from being Rasmus' own pet project that a handful of people had
    contributed to, to being a much more organized team effort. The
    parser was rewritten from scratch by Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans
    and this new parser formed the basis for PHP Version 3.  A lot of
    the utility code from PHP/FI was ported over to PHP3 and a lot of
    it was completely rewritten.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    Today (mid-1998) either PHP/FI or PHP3 ships with a number of
    commercial products such as C2's StrongHold web server and RedHat
    Linux and a conservative estimate based on an extrapolation from
    numbers provided by NetCraft would be that PHP is in use on 150,000
    sites around the world.  To put that in perspective, that is more
    sites than run Netscape's flagship Enterprise server on the Internet.
